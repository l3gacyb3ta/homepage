## Sympathy vs. Empathy notes

Empathy is:
- feels connection
- feeling with people
- does not start with atlesat
- you feel the same thing, or something similar

Empathy can be:
- Perspective taking
- staying out of judgement
- helping

Sympathy is staying away, empathy is feeling _with_ someone

What makes something better is connection.
