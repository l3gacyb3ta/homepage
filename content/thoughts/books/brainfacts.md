# BrainFacts, a primer on the brain and nervous system

## Basics
I already knew this, but we don't just use 10% of our brains! Fun facts. 
1 in 4 people suffer a neurological or psychiatric condition.

There are 2 types of neurons, some excite others and try to make them fire, and some inhibit others from passing signals. The latter can be useful for separating different circuits and columns from crosstalk when that is bad.

Medicines like Fluoxetine (Prozac) are "Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors". These stop "reuptake" which is the process that your brain uses to take neurotransmitters "out of circulation".

Chemicals like THC are called _neuromodulators_, these affect how many neurotransmitters get emitted by the axons, this changing the functioning of the brain.

## Senses & Perception
* ### Vision
Visual processing acconts for about 30% of the cerebral cortex! That's way more than other senses. We also know more about cision than other senses. The retina has built in processing, sort of like modern CMOS chips. 
Human eyes have about 125 million photoreceptors, if each photoreceptor was a pixel, then that's a resolution 3 times larger than 8k!
Interetingly, the eyes are split down the center into right and left visual fields, the left visual field goes to the right hemisphere, and vice verca.
