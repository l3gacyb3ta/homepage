# BrainFacts, a primer on the brain and nervous system
This will mostly be just notes at first, and maybe some reflection later


## Basics
I already knew this, but we don't just use 10% of our brains! Fun facts. 
1 in 4 people suffer a neurological or psychiatric condition.

There are 2 types of neurons, some excite others and try to make them fire, and some inhibit others from passing signals. The latter can be useful for separating different circuits and columns from crosstalk when that is bad.

Medicines like Fluoxetine (Prozac) are "Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors". These stop "reuptake" which is the process that your brain uses to take neurotransmitters "out of circulation".

Chemicals like THC are called _neuromodulators_, these affect how many neurotransmitters get emitted by the axons, this changing the functioning of the brain.

## Senses & Perception
* ### Vision
Visual processing accounts for about 30% of the cerebral cortex! That's way more than other senses. We also know more about vision than other senses. The retina has built in processing, sort of like modern CMOS chips. 
Human eyes have about 125 million photoreceptors, if each photoreceptor was a pixel, then that's a resolution 3 times larger than 8k!  
Interestingly, the eyes are split down the center into right and left visual fields, the left visual field goes to the right hemisphere, and vice versa. The same happens with touch. A little section of the brain in the occipital lobe does the first step of visual processing and some of the steps it goes through will be recognizable to people who have worked in computer vision before. It can do edge detection, as well as motion detection. 

* ### Hearing
"Hair cells" in the cochlea turn the vibration of the fluid into signals. These work by having different membranes tuned to different frequencies, these movements are then detected by the hair cells. Interestingly, the left side of the brain is the primary hemisphere for processing speech. People with damage in this section of the brain can hear you but not understand you. Loss of hearing is caused by loss hair cells, which doen't regrow.

* ### Taste & smell
Test and smell are very similar in that they both use chemicals to get information. Taste buds start to degenerate at around the age of 50, leading to a loss of taste. All tastes are tasted everywhere on the tongue, contrary to common belief.  
With new research into stem cell therapies, we might be one day able to restore taste or smell.

* ### Touch
Touch has two different pathways, A-beta and C fibers, A is faster but thicker, and C is slower but thinner. Touch is mapped onto an area of your brain, where more sensitive areas like the fingers get more space than less sensitive ones. The two areas most sensitive to touch are your lips and your hands. 

* ### Pain
Pain is emotional and sensory. Pain uses it own sensory fibers, called nociceptors. Different nociceptors respond to different kinds of pain, like heat, wounds, or toxins. When damage is detected, chemicals that cause inflammation are released. This then triggers continued pain perception. elongated pain can cause the nervous system in that area to become more sensitive. C Fibers are used for things like ache, and A-delta for precise pain. 

## Movement
Reflexes directly connect to the muscles near them, bypassing the brain altogether. Reflexes exist because it was evolutionarily advantageous to be able to protect yourself from injury fast. 

## Learning, Memory & Emotion
There are different types of memory:
* ### Declarative memory
This type memory is used for data, facts, and events.
* ### Semantic
This is for cultural knowledge, ideas, and concepts. For example names of cities, definitions of words, how to do math, or dates.
* ### Episodic
These are memories of experiences, like remembering sounds, sights and emotions connected to an event.
Emotional importance of a memory is determined by the amygdala. The amygdala also regulates fight or flight.
* ### Working memory
This is like RAM in a computer, a far more limited in quantity short-term memory solution for easy manipulation.
* ### Nondeclarative memory
This type is recalled without effort like motor skills.

### How memories are saved
Memories are encoded into the shape and number of synapses, as well as how many receptors there are. 

### Emotions
The amygdala, insula and a part of the midbrain are most linked to emotion. The brain assigns good emotions to things that will promote better emotional advantages, and bad to things that wont. Emotional parts of the brain change over time, especially in teens, and this transitional period may explain why teens are more prone to risk.  
To make good things worth your while, the brain can use rewards pathways like the dopamine one (Which iirc is one of the things that doesn't work as intended in ADHD suffering people). There are also dopamine inhibitors, which can be used for punishment.
